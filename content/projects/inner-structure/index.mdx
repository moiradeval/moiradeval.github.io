This work examines the inner structure of the self.
Dark, fragmented forms move across a restrained grey surface,
suggesting supports, interruptions, or psychological fault lines.
There is no fixed center.
The structure unfolds, pauses, and resumes —
mirroring the way thoughts, memories, and self-perception are formed.
Rather than offering a complete system, the painting presents
an unfinished order.
Here, the self is not a stable conclusion,
but an ongoing process of construction, disruption, and continuation.
