The rose represents the self —
fragile yet deliberate, delicate yet demanding care.
It is not chosen for its beauty alone,
but for the responsibility it carries.
To love the rose is to stay present,
to protect what is easily wounded,
and to accept what cannot be replaced.
In this work, the rose becomes a quiet mirror of the inner world.
It speaks of attachment, vulnerability, and devotion —
reminding us that what we care for shapes who we become.
To hold the rose is to acknowledge the self:
not as something perfect,
but as something worth tending to.
