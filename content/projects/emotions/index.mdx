After my grandfather passed away, the world I once knew grew hollow.
The color in this painting is drawn from memory.
It is the color of the clothes I wore on the day everything shifted — a day filled with urgency, helpless motion, and the silence that followed. Since then, this color has remained with me, holding the weight of what could not be saved.
In my dreams, I try to reach my grandfather.
I sense his presence, feel how close he is —
yet when my arms close, they gather only air.
This work is not only about loss,
but about what remains.
About the space left behind —
where love continues without a body,
where memory returns in quiet waves,
and where the self learns to live
with what can be felt,
but never held.
