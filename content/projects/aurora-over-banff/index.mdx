The aurora over Banff is not only a natural phenomenon,
but an inner experience.
Beneath the northern lights, the landscape becomes quiet,
and the self becomes visible.
The shifting colors mirror thoughts that cannot be fully named —
fleeting, luminous, and deeply personal.
In this moment, nature does not overwhelm.
It reflects.
The vastness of the sky invites stillness,
allowing the self to exist without explanation.
