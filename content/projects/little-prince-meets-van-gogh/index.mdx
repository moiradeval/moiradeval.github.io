This painting imagines a moment where The Little Prince steps into Van Gogh’s universe.
Set beneath a swirling, star-filled sky inspired by The Starry Night, the small figure stands alone on a quiet hill, holding a rose — a symbol of love, responsibility, and longing. The familiar Van Gogh-like movement of the sky contrasts with the stillness of the figure, creating a dialogue between innocence and intensity.
Here, the Little Prince is not lost.
He is observing, listening, and learning.
The work brings together two worlds:
the childlike clarity of The Little Prince and the emotional turbulence of Van Gogh, exploring how wonder, loneliness, and beauty coexist within the human experience.
